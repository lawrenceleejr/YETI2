# YETI 2 - Jan 2023

## Registration

Register by Jan 17 5pm for earliest information release. (Late registration possible until Jan 19 5pm.)

To register, add a comment to the [relevant GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lawrenceleejr/YETI2/issues/1). Put your UTK email address in the comment.

## Primary Challenge

Registrants have been emailed a personalized dataset. Each line is an entry and there are eight columns of floats. The first four columns represent a “truth” four-momentum (as px, py, pz, E) while the last four columns represent a measured value of that same four-momentum (again, as px, py, pz, E). Using this dataset, make a plot of the correlation between the pseudorapidity (eta) residual and the azimuthal angle (phi) residual. (A residual is the measured quantity minus the truth value.)

The resulting distribution will contain a secret personalized key represented in a common encoding scheme. Use this key as a cipher key in the tool here (*) to encrypt a message describing your favorite fun fact. Post a new issue in the GitHub repository titled “{Your GitHub username} Submission” and post your encrypted message in the body. Do not include your secret key or the decrypted message. 

We will then attempt to decrypt your message using your pre-assigned keys.
